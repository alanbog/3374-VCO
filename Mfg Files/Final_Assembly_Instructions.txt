These are instructions to turn the PCB assemblies into the final product.

1.  If the PCBAs are panelized, depanelize them, and sand any remaining mouse bites or rough edges.

2.  Solder the Flip-Pins. I recommend using 20-pin Flip-Pins. Two sets of 20-pin Flip-Pins can be used for every two boards.
    Insert the Flip-Pins in the bottom of the board. Make sure that the plastic aligner does not overlap the thermistor (U7).

    I found that it was best to use a flux pen and thin solder (0.015" diameter).

3.  Clean flux off of the boards. I used isopropyl alcohol and an ESD-safe brush. 

4.  Add a blob of MG Chemicals 8349TFM that completely encapsulates U7, Q14, and Q15. These components are on the bottom of the board opposite from the pin 1 marking. Let cure for at least 16 hours.
